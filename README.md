# ApartmentHubHTML

An organizational tool for me and my two other roommates, so we can easily keep track of chores, reminders, and achievements.

This originally started in Python with the Kivy library (https://github.com/GusVieweg/ApartmentHub) but since that became increasingly complex (though it solidified OOP concepts I was struggling with), I decided to shift over to HTML/CSS/Javascript.  They were my first "languages" so it's nice to get back into them.  I'm by no means a web developer but this seemed like the best tool for the job, accompanied by JSON, LocalStorage, and the Google Calendar iframe, this is turning out pretty well.

July 3, 2016 - This is currently the first full working version of it.  One of the pages, Where You At (wua.html/css/js) is still on here for future use, though I doubt I will be adding it for it will just read off of the calendar, which everyone can read themselves.  Improvements I'm looking into making include some kind of camera functionality for the guestbook as well as cleaning up the code a little bit (merging the chore/guestbook functionality into fewer functions, spaces vs. tabs, HTML/CSS/JS standard protocols for readability).
