An organizational tool for me and my two other roommates, so we can easily keep track of chores, reminders, and achievements.

This [originally started in Python](https://github.com/GusVieweg/ApartmentHub) with the Kivy library but since that became increasingly complex (though it solidified OOP concepts I was struggling with), I decided to shift over to HTML/CSS/Javascript.  They were my first "languages" so it's nice to get back into them.  I'm by no means a web developer but this seemed like the best tools for the job, accompanied by JSON, LocalStorage, and the Google Calendar iframe, this is turning out pretty well.
