# ApartmentHubHTML

An organizational tool for me and my two other roommates, so we can easily keep track of chores, reminders, and achievements.

This originally started in Python with the Kivy library <link to GitHub> but since that became increasingly complex, I decided to shift over to HTML/CSS/Javascript.  They were my first "languages" so it's nice to get back into them.  I'm by no means a web developer but this seemed like the best tools for the job, accompanied by JSON, LocalStorage, and the Google Calendar iframe, this is turning out pretty well.
